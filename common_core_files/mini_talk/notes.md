# My Notes

- I used write() with single quotes to write a single char, since the double quotes acts as a string and includes '\0' at the end.
- I used ft_putstr_fd() instead of ft_printf() for a lighter processing since ft_print() does parsing and validation to detect what to print.

# ToDo:

- I got stuck at handling "why the scond message isn't recieved".
